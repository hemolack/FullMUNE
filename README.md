# Full MUNE

This project is an attempt to fully implement and automate The Madey Upy Namey Emulator (MUNE) found here: https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/rkmo0t9k4Q

It is a generic Dungeon Master emulator used to play tabletop roleplaying games without a human running the game.

Adjectives and nouns for the Portent feature come from the WordNet database: https://wordnet.princeton.edu/license-and-commercial-use
